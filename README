These are my files to solve the Google Codejam questions. In 2010 I gave it a try without much luck. After seeing the answers I realized how much I was complicating it. I'm not sure the 2010 code even builds but it's in there for entertainment purposes.

In 2011 I tried again with a little more understanding. I hadn't been practicing or anything but I managed to get the 30 points (25 required) to get through the qualification round. I was struggling through challenge C when time ran out. After reading about the solutions I realized I had basically had it finished right away but I had second guessed myself and kept changing it until I had a solution that didn't work at all.
